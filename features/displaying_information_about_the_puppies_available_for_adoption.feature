  This screen rally has no behavior. It simply displays the
  list of puppies available for adoption.

    When I am looking at the available puppies

  Scenario: Knowing the name of the available puppies
    Then I can see that "Sparky" is available for adoption

  Scenario: Knowing the breed and gender of the available puppies
    Then I can see the "Ruby Sue" is a "Pit Bull Terrier"
    And I can see that "Ruby Sue" is a "Female"

  Scenario: Being overwhelmed by the cuteness of the available puppies
